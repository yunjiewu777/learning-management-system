# Learning Management System

## Introduction

This is the code for the final project of Emory University CS377 Database System

- I designed a normalized SQL database and implemented an interactive website for students and instructors for course browsing, assignment grading, transcript request, and also a Q&A page like Piazza for each course

- A pdf file explaining more about the database design and what each PHP file does can be found [here](https://github.com/yunjiewu777/learning-management-system/blob/main/course-requirement/project-explanation.pdf)
