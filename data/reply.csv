1,I think we are trying to list out the last name of the athletes that are in countries that neither have competed yet or none of their athletes have ranked in the top 3 so far.,2021/9/5 16:35,ize3lkeNiR,Question 1 Clarification,YjairWTC40

1,The relational schema is the structure and design of the relation such as the attribute list. The relation state is like the table content at any given moment.,2021/9/5 13:35,ize3lkeNiR,Conceptual question - relational state vs relational schema,YjairWTC40
2,You can draw an analogy between the relational schema and classes in Java. Then you can think of relation state as the objects that are defined at that particular time.,2021/9/5 15:45,A1Kcf8Z1u3,Conceptual question - relational state vs relational schema,YjairWTC40
1,The numbers seem to be incorrect and it seems the points were posted?,2021/10/15 13:32,ize3lkeNiR,Assignment 2 Graded,YjairWTC40

1,You can assume that each city has a distance name so you would consider Atlanta GA to be the same name as Atlanta FL,2021/10/9 10:24,A1Kcf8Z1u3,HW3 Q2,YjairWTC40
2,Does this apply for Q9 as well?,2021/10/25 13:45,Xo3aGKAsfE,HW3 Q2,YjairWTC40

1,I believe just choosing a random card from the deck to deal out cards is enough.,2021/10/1 17:41,qBhsb9AT1D,Shuffle Deck,IvQtGSPKP9
2,As long as there is some point of randomness that is involved it will be sufficient.,2021/10/1 18:51,A1Kcf8Z1u3,Shuffle Deck,IvQtGSPKP9
3,Should we consider the situation when the deck is running out of cards?,2021/10/3 4:32,YXCMIivcy6,Shuffle Deck,IvQtGSPKP9
4,Yes your application should gracefully handle this situation.,2021/10/3 8:47,cp5asEx6KR,Shuffle Deck,IvQtGSPKP9
1,I think there's no specific rule in Blackjack for when an ace is counted as a 1 or an 11. I assumed we have to keep track of the total score in both cases: when the ace is a 1 and when the ace is an 11.,2021/10/1 20:23,wUSNkrt2i7,Ace value,IvQtGSPKP9
2,The general rule of thumb is that the Ace will take on the value of whatever will help the holder the most,2021/10/1 23:22,RxNqRHaaoI,Ace value,IvQtGSPKP9
1,Take advantage of what the method move() returns. It is true in certain situations and false in others. You can then push depending on the value.,2021/10/14 17:11,YXCMIivcy6,Possible legal moves,IvQtGSPKP9
2,The move method checks if a move is legal for you. You should use this method to change the behavior of your code based on whether or not it returns true or false.,2021/10/15 5:19,RwKSObZt8b,Possible legal moves,IvQtGSPKP9
1,This actually happened to me as well on the previous assignment. I was told that I wouldn't be penalized so I think you'll be fine,2021/10/16 10:04,qBhsb9AT1D,Filename changed after resubmission,IvQtGSPKP9
2,Resubmissions with the same filename on Canvas will automatically add a -1 etc to the files. The student answer is correct in that you will not be penalized for this.,2021/10/16 12:01,QVsfnLS8nP,Filename changed after resubmission,IvQtGSPKP9
